We have come a long way since the [first FAUCET conference in 2017](http://2017.conference.faucet.nz/).
Now is a great time to take stock of what has been achieved, but also to reaffirm our no-nonsense commitment to deployable SDN.
FAUCETCon 2019 is an opportunity to bring together our community to review, discuss, debate, and chart the way forward.

The conference programme committee hereby invites interested speakers to submit proposals for presentations or demonstrations.
Submissions should focus on topics of interest to our community of network operators, developers, and equipment and software vendors.

This may include (but is not limited to):

* Hands-on FAUCET deployment and operations in the lab or in production.
* Network integration and automation using FAUCET SDN.
* Advanced security and admission control, network monitoring/measurement, etc.
* Emerging network technologies, protocols, hardware and tools.

Please submit your proposals to [cfp@faucet.nz](mailto:cfp@faucet.nz) by **Friday 30 August 2019**.
