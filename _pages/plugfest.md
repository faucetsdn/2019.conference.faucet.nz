The Faucet PlugFest is being held on Monday 21st October, at the same venue as the Faucet conference.

The PlugFest is where switch vendors and FAUCET developers get together to test the interoperability of Faucet-compatible switches.

The switches will be working together in a real physical network, all under Faucet's control.
Switches are expected to pass Faucet's integration tests before the PlugFest.
Last year, the PlugFest was held in Dallas, TX at [SC18](https://scinet.supercomputing.org/workshop/sites/default/files/FAUCET_SC18-101118.pdf)
demonstrating a multivendor 100G network.

This PlugFest we will be building a network with redundant switches and links,
using Faucet distributed switching (also known as Faucet stacking), with 802.1X authentication.

If you're a switch vendor or Faucet developer, the Faucet PlugFest will be of interest to you.

You can find further details, including the PlugFest topology, at the
[PlugFest Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/waikato.ac.nz/forum/#!forum/faucet-plugfest.group).
